                  Hello There,<br>
                  <br>
                  I was one of those typical kids who had no idea of what they wanted to do. The "dream" career pretty much rotated on a weekly basis until college. From an early age on, however, I was always pretty imaginative. I enjoyed creating worlds and stories. I'm sure my neighbors were fairly concerned when I ran around the backyard, tossing a football to myself, imagining an entire Hall of Fame career in the course of a half-hour. I have plenty of memories of epic lightsaber battles around the school, or begging my mom to buy me a new pack of Yu-Gi-Oh cards (remember when McDonald's used to give them as Happy Meal Toys? The past was truly better).<br>
                  <br>
                  I probably spent way too much time in fantasy-land as a kid, because, in some ways, I feel like I never left. I still love to create worlds and explore the infinite bounty of ridiculousness that exists in my brain. I did, however, realize that while an eight year old kid running around the backyard talking to himself may be innocent and maybe even charming, the same can not be said for a twenty-something year old adult. In order to trick society to allow me to continue my whackiness, I decided to go into Computer Science. Along the way, I discovered something about myself: all the time I had spent as a kid in fantasy-land was not a waste at all, it&rsquo;s my greatest strength!<br>
                  <br>
                  So what kind of employee would you be getting in hiring me? Well, I can't tell you exactly, but I can promise that you'll be getting someone who is passionate about creating new and exciting worlds and adventures. I constantly strive to improve myself and my abilities, so that I can truly be an asset to the people I work with.<br>
